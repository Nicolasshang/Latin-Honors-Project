# Latin-Honors-Project

A quick thing we dececided to do for a school project. Yes I know, some of this code is stolen but shhhh we have a deadline to meet.

Anyways, this project uses the CLTK (Classical Language Toolkit), which is developed by the authors of `this publication <https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-demo.3>`:

   Johnson, Kyle P., Patrick J. Burns, John Stewart, Todd Cook, Cl√©ment Besnier, and William J. B.  Mattingly. "The Classical Language Toolkit: An NLP Framework for Pre-Modern Languages." In *Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations*, pp. 20-29. 2021. 10.18653/v1/2021.acl-demo.3
