# Latin-Honors-Project

A quick thing we dececided to do for a school project. 

Anyways, this project uses the CLTK (Classical Language Toolkit), which is developed by the authors of this publication (https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-demo.3):

   Johnson, Kyle P., Patrick J. Burns, John Stewart, Todd Cook, Cl√©ment Besnier, and William J. B.  Mattingly. "The Classical Language Toolkit: An NLP Framework for Pre-Modern Languages." In *Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations*, pp. 20-29. 2021. 10.18653/v1/2021.acl-demo.3

Note: Most of this code is NOT ours. We procrastinated this project until a week before the deadline, where we just decided to shamelessly take the code from wjbmattingly's course on Latin NER (https://github.com/wjbmattingly/latin_ner_lesson) and his lessons on Latin text processing using CLTK (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2VXyKi-KpYuKYUkf1aODP4vHpOh7yvjr). All credit goes to him.
